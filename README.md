# eiffel

This crate provides a set of macros inspired by the Eiffel programming language's
features for invariant checking. These features include checks for loops, entry, exit, and more.
The Eiffel language's options for invariant checking serve as the basis for the design
and functionality of the macros in this crate.
Please note that this crate is still a work in progress. As such, some features may not be fully
implemented or may undergo significant changes in future updates.
Contributions and feedback are always welcome.
